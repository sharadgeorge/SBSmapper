See below for codes and definitions. This two character extension is to be assigned only from documentation on the anaesthetic form.
	American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification
	the following table to indicate the ASA score is provided for use with the appropriate codes in blocks [1333] Analgesia and anaesthesia during labour and caesarean section, [1909] Conduction anaesthesia and [1910] Cerebral anaesthesia. the first character of the two character extension of the procedure code is the ASA score as represented in the first column.
	the second character of the extension represents whether a modifier of 'E' is recorded on the anaesthetic form in addition to the ASA score. 'E' signifies a procedure that is being performed as an emergency and may be associated with a suboptimal opportunity for risk modification. the modifier 'E' is to be represented by the digit '0'.
	This information must be documented on the anaesthetic form at the time the procedure took place before assigning these codes. Where there is no documentation of ASA score or the emergency modifier is not indicated, filler digits of  '9' should be assigned.
Block details : See extension codes
	Emergency modifier '0' is not valid for use with ASA score 6.
